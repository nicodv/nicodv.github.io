Drafts are unpublished posts.
The format of these files is without a date: title.MARKUP.

To preview your site with drafts, run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch.
Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date,
and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
