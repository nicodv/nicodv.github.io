Well-formatted site data should be placed here.
The Jekyll engine will autoload all data files
(using either the .yml, .yaml, .json, .csv or .tsv formats and extensions)
in this directory, and they will be accessible via `site.data`.

If there's a file members.yml under the directory, then you can access contents
of the file through site.data.members.
